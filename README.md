# A CLI to help with tedious Advent of Code work
Tired of setting up the same repo for a new puzzle ? Tired of copy pasting the example input into your unit test template ?
Haoc aims to be the one stop tool to ease everything about AoC... but for the fun parts !

# Proposed API
- haoc init will create a new folder, fill it with a preset code template and open up today's problem in your browser.
- haoc submit will run your code on your input and submit the result to your own, previously set up, AoC account.
- haoc check will check that the set up is correct and connection to the AoC servers are ok.

# Supported platforms
I aim to support windows and linux.
